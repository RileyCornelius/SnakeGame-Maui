### Description
A basic snake game written in C# using Multiple platform UI framework. This app will work on IOS, Android, Windows and Mac but has only been tested on Windows and Android. The snake can be controlled by swipe, arrow buttons or arrow keys on desktop.

The project is based on [OttoBotCode's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzAXxFBbVoE&ab_channel=OttoBotCode) WPF application.
